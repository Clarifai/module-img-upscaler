# Image Upscaler

This module utilizes the `stabilityai-upscale` model from [Clarifai community] (https://clarifai.com/stability-ai/Upscale/models/stabilityai-upscale) to upscale your images. You can enlarge an image by uploading it and specifying the desired width parameter. Additionally, it automatically uploads the enhanced image to your app's inputs.
